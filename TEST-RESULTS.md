## 🎯 Manual Testing Instructions

### Option A: Using Vercel Dev (Recommended for Full Testing)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Start development server with API support
vercel dev

# Open in browser
# → http://localhost:3000
```

✅ **Pros**: Full API functionality, accurate production environment
⚠️  **Note**: May require Vercel project setup

### Option B: Using Vite Dev Server (UI Testing Only)

```bash
# Start Vite development server
npm run dev

# Open in browser
# → http://localhost:5173
```

✅ **Pros**: Fast, simple setup
⚠️  **Cons**: API endpoints won't work (need Vercel for serverless functions)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: API endpoint not found (404)
**Solution**: Use `vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev` to enable API routes

### Issue: Analysis takes too long
**Expected**: 5-15 seconds for Claude API processing
**Action**: Wait patiently, check network tab for response

### Issue: "API authentication failed"
**Solution**: Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in `.env` file

### Issue: Low confidence score
**Reason**: Wine label might be unclear, angled, or partially obscured
**Action**: Try uploading a clearer image with better lighting

### Issue: Photo doesn't display after upload
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify file size < 5MB
